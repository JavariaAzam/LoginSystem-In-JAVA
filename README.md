# LoginSystem-In-JAVA
This project is a simple GUI-based User Registration and Login System built using Java Swing. It demonstrates how to design an interactive desktop application where multiple users can register and log in with unique credentials.

Features
User Registration: New users can create an account by entering a username and password.

Validation: The system prevents duplicate usernames and requires both fields to be filled.

Login System: Registered users can log in using their credentials.

Feedback Messages: The application provides confirmation messages for successful registration, login success, or failure.

Multi-User Support: Multiple users can register and later log in, as credentials are stored in memory.

Technical Details
Built using Java Swing for GUI.

Uses HashMap to store user credentials in memory.

Designed with clean and beginner-friendly code with explanatory comments.

No external dependencies required â€” only core Java.

Usage
Run the program.

Register a new user with a username and password.

After successful registration, log in with your credentials.
